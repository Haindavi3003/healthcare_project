Project Name->Healthcare Data Analysis 

description ->
To analyze patient data in order to uncover trends and correlations that can 
provide insights into specific health conditions. This could help in 
understanding disease patterns, improving patient care, and supporting 
data-driven medical decisions. 

Technologies ->
Python, Pandas, and visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn). 

python code explanation ->
In the code we are going to see how to use python  libraries like Pandas and for visualisation matplotlib , seaborn

for data manipulation
Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis in general it have two data structures known as data frame and series 
In this program we are going to see some of the data manipulation techniques ,It is also use it for structure datas like csv Excel SQL databases etc 
and this project exports a CSV file and going to converted into a Excel sheet
for performing data manipulation techniques like data updations , handling missing values and finding the averages, means ,distributions ,correlation matrix and heat map

for visualization
By using the visualization tools like matplotlib , seaborn we plot some of the graphs 
by using the data found from the Pandas lets plot some of the graphs like 
1.histplot(Histogram) the distribution of Ages 
2.Count plot for gender distribution
3.bar plot showing disease condition distribution across different age groups 
4.plot a heatmap according to the correlation found

for data processing 
scikit-learn (sklearn) is a widely used Python library for machine learning 
in this project sklearn is used for finding mean squared error
